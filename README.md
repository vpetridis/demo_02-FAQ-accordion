![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on the device screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
 (Added extra interactivity: for inactive items on the accordion)

## Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS (no pre-processors)
